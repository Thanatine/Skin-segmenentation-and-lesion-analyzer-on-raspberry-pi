Find a spot/growth on your skin that you want to analyze and place the projected light circle over the area and press down gently.<br><br>

Now, look at the screen and make sure the area you want analyzed is located in the box. If not, adjust it accordingly.<br><br>

Once youâ€™re satisfied with the placement, tap the screen to capture the image to be processed using our advanced machine learning algorithm.<br><br>

Wait for the result within a few seconds and send the result with bluetooth to your own device.
